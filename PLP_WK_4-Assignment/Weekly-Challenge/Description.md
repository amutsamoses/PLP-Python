Week 4 Challenge: Python File Processing

This project is my solution for the Week 4 coding challenge, where I was tasked with creating a Python program to read, process, and write to a text file.

It was a great opportunity to practice file I/O operations, string manipulation, and basic Python automation.

ðŸ“‚ Files in This Project
File Name Description
input.txt The source file containing the initial text for processing.
week4_file_processor.py My Python script that reads, processes, and writes data to the output file.
output.txt The result file generated by the program. It contains the uppercase version of the text along with the word count.
ðŸ›  My Process

Creating Input File
I started by creating an input.txt file with at least five lines of text.

Writing the Script

Used with open(...) for safe file handling.

Read the content of input.txt and stored it in a variable.

Split the content to count the words accurately.

Processing the Text

Converted all text to uppercase using .upper().

Counted the total number of words in the file.

Writing the Output

Created a new file output.txt.

Saved both the processed text and the word count in the file.

Confirmation

Displayed a success message in the console once output.txt was created.

ðŸš€ How to Run the Program
Option 1: Interactive Mode

Ensure Python 3 is installed.

Open your terminal or command prompt.

Navigate to the folder containing week4_file_processor.py.

Run:

python week4_file_processor.py

Type in your custom lines of text when prompted.

Check output.txt for the processed content.

Option 2: Using Pre-made input.txt

Create an input.txt file manually in the same directory.

Add your desired text to the file.

Run:

python week4_file_processor.py

Type no when asked to create a new input file.

Open output.txt to view the processed result.

ðŸ’¡ What I Learned

Proper use of Pythonâ€™s with open() for handling files.

String manipulation methods like .upper().

Word counting using .split() for simple and efficient logic.

Writing clean, readable, and maintainable code.
