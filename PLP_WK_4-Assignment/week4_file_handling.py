# This script demonstrates two core concepts in Python:
# 1. File reading and writing (File I/O)
# 2. Exception handling with try-except blocks
#
# Features:
# - Option 1: Reads a sample input file, processes its content
#             (converts to uppercase), and writes to a new file.
# - Option 2: Prompts user for a file name, tries to read it,
#             and handles errors gracefully if it doesn't exist.
# ===============================================================

    3. Convert the content to uppercase.
    4. Create or overwrite `output.txt` and write the processed content.
    5. Print a success message or handle errors if the file is missing.
