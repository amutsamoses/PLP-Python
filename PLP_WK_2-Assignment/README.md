# Week Two Assignment

## 📄 Description

This week’s assignment focuses on practicing **Python lists** and their built-in methods.  
I worked on creating, modifying, and managing list elements to better understand how Python handles data in lists.

## 🎯 Objectives

- Learn how to create and manipulate lists in Python.
- Practice using common list methods like `append()`, `insert()`, `extend()`, `remove()`, and `sort()`.
- Understand how to retrieve the index of a specific element in a list.

## 📝 Steps I Followed

1. **Created an empty list** named `my_list`.  
2. **Appended values** `10`, `20`, `30`, and `40` to the list.  
3. **Inserted the value** `15` in the second position (index `1`).  
4. **Extended the list** by adding `[50, 60, 70]` to it.  
5. **Removed the last element** from the list using the `pop()` method.  
6. **Sorted the list** in ascending order.  
7. **Found and printed the index** of the value `30` in the list.  

## 💻 Example Output

After running the script, the final version of `my_list` should look like this:
