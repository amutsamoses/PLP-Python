# Week 2 - Control Flows and Functions Coding Challenges

This assignment focuses on practicing **basic control flows** and **function definitions** in Python.  
The tasks include creating simple functions, using conditional logic, and returning appropriate boolean values.

## **Tasks**

### **1️⃣ Large Power**

- **Objective:**  
  Write a function that checks if the result of raising a number (`base`) to the power of another (`exponent`) is greater than 5000.  
- **File:** `large_power.py`  
- **Example:**  

  ```python
  large_power(2, 12)   # Returns True because 2^12 = 4096 (False in this case)
  large_power(10, 4)   # Returns True because 10^4 = 10000

2️⃣ Divisible By Ten
Objective:
Write a function that checks if a given number is divisible by 10.

File: divisible_by_ten.py

Example:

python
Copy code
divisible_by_ten(100)   # Returns True
divisible_by_ten(33)    # Returns False
How to Run
Clone or download this repository.

Open your terminal in the project folder.

Run the desired script:

bash
Copy code
python large_power.py
or

bash
Copy code
python divisible_by_ten.py
