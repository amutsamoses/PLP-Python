# Week 5: Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Challenge 🎯

This folder contains my solutions for the **Week 5 OOP assignment** as part of my learning journey at PLP Academy.  
The tasks explore **classes, objects, constructors, inheritance, and polymorphism** in Python.

## **📌 Assignments**

### **1️⃣ Assignment 1: Design Your Own Class**

In this activity, I designed a **Smartphone** class to simulate real-world properties and actions of a smartphone.

**Key Features**

- Attributes: brand, model, battery percentage, and status (on/off)
- Methods:
  - `power_on()` - Turns the phone on
  - `power_off()` - Turns the phone off
  - `charge()` - Increases battery level
- Demonstrates **inheritance** with a subclass `SmartphonePro` that adds a unique method for taking photos.

**File:** `assignment1_custom_class.py`

### **2️⃣ Assignment 2: Polymorphism Challenge**

This activity demonstrates **polymorphism** by defining a `move()` method that behaves differently for different classes:

- `Car.move()` → "Driving 🚗"
- `Plane.move()` → "Flying ✈️"
- `Bicycle.move()` → "Pedaling 🚴"

**File:** `assignment2_polymorphism.py`

## **🚀 How to Run**

1. Open a terminal and navigate to the `Week5_OOP` folder:

   ```bash
   cd Week5_OOP

Run Assignment 1:

bash
Copy code
python assignment1_custom_class.py
Run Assignment 2:

bash
Copy code
python assignment2_polymorphism.py
💡 Learning Outcomes
Designed and instantiated custom classes.

Used constructors (**init**) to initialize object attributes.

Applied inheritance for code reuse and extension.

Implemented polymorphism for dynamic behavior across classes.
